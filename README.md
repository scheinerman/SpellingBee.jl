# SpellingBee

This module solves [NY Times Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee) puzzles.

## Usage

Suppose the center letter in the puzzle is `W` and the surrounding letters are `ODNLET`. 

+ To get all solutions, use `bee_solver('w',"odnlet")`.
+ To get just the pangram solutions, use `pangram("wodnlet")`.
```
julia> pangram("wodnlet")
1-element Vector{String}:
 "LETDOWN"
 ```

`bee_solver` takes an optional third integer argument giving the minimum length of a word (default is 4).

### All in one
If `bee_solver` is given a string of seven letters, the first letter is understood to be the center letter
and the remaining six are the outer letters. This version prints the pangrams, the number of words found,  
and then returns the list of words it found.
```
 bee_solver("wodnlet")
Pangrams:
	LETDOWN
85 words found
85-element Vector{String}:
 "DEWOOL"
 "DOWD"
 "DOWED"
 "DOWEL"
 "DOWL"
 "DOWN"
 â‹®
 "WOOLEN"
 "WOOLENET"
 "WOOLWEED"
 "WOON"
 "WOTE"
 "WOWT"
```



## List of Words

By default we use the list of words found in the file `/usr/share/dict/words`.  To change this default, edit `src/SpellingBee.jl` and change the value assigned to `WORD_LIST`.

To switch to a different word list in the middle of a session, use
`SpellingBee.load_all_words(filename)`. Any word in the file `filename` that contains a 
capital letter is ignored.
